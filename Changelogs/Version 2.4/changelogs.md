# **Version 2.4 - Housekeeping**

## Short list:

- Cars have been removed... for now...
- Office names have changed
- Instructors now have a parking space :)
- Removed Staff lineup
- Various bug fixes
- Minor Lag Optimization

## Full guide:

| Update        | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cars have been removed | Cars have been creating a lot of lag and were also being misused by staff. However we might see them againðŸ‘€|
| Office names have changed  | From Head Instructor+ everyone has their own office. Advisors share their office. |
| Instructors now have a parking space  | This is just a small aesthetic change since there are no longer cars, but we just wanted equality for all. |
| Removed Staff lineup | Staff lineup was outdated, there might be alternative version of this coming soon. |
| Various bug fixes | Fixed minor issues that caused the whiteboard to have a delay. Fixed broken scripts, like the staff golf-carts. | 
| Minor Lag Optimization | Compressed some code, cleaned up RBXConnections and instances to avoid memory leaks, reduced some textures on trees for a smooother experience.|


## Additional Notes:
- Models now load arround your player camera. If you want the least ammount of lag possible, stay in first person.
- The maximum average ping should be 200ms, if you experience crazy ammounts of lag, try to:
  - Reduce the graphics quality in Roblox
  - Improve your internet connection
  - Deleting textures On Windows/Mac
- If none of the following works, please DM a developer with screenshots of what's happening to you.
